**Hi, my name is Grzegorz Mucha** ðŸ‘‹

I have Master's degree in Automation and Robotics. Currently I work as SCADA system designer. 

Really enjoy working with open-minded people, sharing skills and experience with others.

I would like to start my journey with the world of data and I'm mastering my skills in Excel, SQL, Tableau.

In my free time like reading books, playing football, cycling, swimming and learning foreign languages.
